Transfer Learning applied to PlantVillage Disease Classification Challenge Crowd ai


In this notebooks are applied transfer learning applied to a PlantVillage Disease Classification Challenge hosted by [crowdai](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/plantvillage-disease-classification-challenge), more especifically it was a resnet 50  network  applied.  But the data is highly unbalanced, for that reason I try some approach modifying the number of images in training set and dev set, and changing some network parameters.

The challenge is ended, for that reason the forecast was evaluated with the same sample and used the accuracy as metric.
